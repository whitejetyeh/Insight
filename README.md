Insight demo project: "HOLOTALK"

This project implements autoencoder to reconstructure a 3D protrait from one 2D frontal picture. The 3D protrait is holographically projectable by a holographic pyramid.

A webapp of holotalk has been established. After clicking a button, webcam is activated for taking a picture. Then a single user's face will be cropped and passed through Convolutional autoencoder for reconstruction.
